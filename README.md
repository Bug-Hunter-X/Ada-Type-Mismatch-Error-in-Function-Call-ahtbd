This repository demonstrates a common Ada programming error: a type mismatch in a function call.  The `Add_Numbers` function expects two integer arguments, but in the `Main` procedure, a string literal ("5") is passed as the second argument, resulting in a compilation error. The solution shows how to correctly pass integer arguments to the function.
